# Unbelievable

You burden me with your questions<br>
You'd have me tell no lies<br>
You're always asking what it's all about, darlin' listen to my replies<br>
You say to me I don't talk enough<br>
But when I do I'm a fool<br>
These times I've spent, I've realized<br>
I'm going to shoot through and leave you<br>
<br>
The things, you say<br>
Your purple prose just gives you away<br>
The things, you say<br>
You're unbelievable (what the fuck?)<br>
<br>
You burden me with your problems<br>
By telling me more about mine<br>
I'm always so concerned<br>
With the way you say you've always go to stop to think of us<br>
Being one is more than I ever know<br>
But this time, I realize I'm going to shoot through and leave you<br>
<br>
The things, you say<br>
Your purple prose just gives you away<br>
The things, you say<br>
You're unbelievable (what the fuck?)<br>
<br>
Seemingly lastless, don't mean you can ask us<br>
Pushing down the relative, bringing out your higher self<br>
Think of the fine times, pushing down the better few<br>
Instead of bringing out the clues<br>
To what the world and everything you answer to<br>
Brace yourself with the grace of ease<br>
I know this world ain't what it seems (what the fuck? Whoa man!)<br>
It's unbelievable<br>
